 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. The single-sided two-way ranging scheme implemented here has to be considered carefully as the accuracy of the distance measured is highly
 *    sensitive to the clock offset error between the devices and the length of the response delay between frames. To achieve the best possible
 *    accuracy, this response delay must be kept as low as possible. In order to do so, 6.8 Mbps data rate is used in this example and the response
 *    delay between frames is defined as low as possible. The user is referred to User Manual for more details about the single-sided two-way ranging
 *    process.  NB:SEE ALSO NOTE 11.
 * 2. The sum of the values is the TX to RX antenna delay, this should be experimentally determined by a calibration process. Here we use a hard coded
 *    value (expected to be a little low so a positive error will be seen on the resultant distance estimate. For a real production application, each
 *    device should have its own antenna delay properly calibrated to get good precision when performing range measurements.
 * 3. This timeout is for complete reception of a frame, i.e. timeout duration must take into account the length of the expected frame. Here the value
 *    is arbitrary but chosen large enough to make sure that there is enough time to receive the complete response frame sent by the responder at the
 *    6.8M data rate used (around 200 s).
 * 4. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW1000 OTP memory.
 * 5. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *     DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
