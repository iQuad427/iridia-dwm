*  @brief   Single-sided two-way ranging (SS TWR) initiator example code
*
*           This is a simple code example which acts as the initiator in a SS TWR distance measurement exchange. This application sends a "poll"
*           frame (recording the TX time-stamp of the poll), after which it waits for a "response" message from the "DS TWR responder" example
*           code (companion to this application) to complete the exchange. The response message contains the remote responder's time-stamps of poll
*           RX, and response TX. With this data and the local time-stamps, (of poll TX and response RX), this example application works out a value
*           for the time-of-flight over-the-air and, thus, the estimated distance between the two devices, which it writes to the LCD.
*
*
*           Notes at the end of this file, expand on the inline comments.

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
* NOTES:
*
* 1. The frames used here are Decawave specific ranging frames, complying with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard data frame encoding. The frames are the
*    following:
*     - a poll message sent by the initiator to trigger the ranging exchange.
*     - a response message sent by the responder to complete the exchange and provide all information needed by the initiator to compute the
*       time-of-flight (distance) estimate.
*    The first 10 bytes of those frame are common and are composed of the following fields:
*     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8841 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit addressing).
*     - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
*     - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA).
*     - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 2 below.
*     - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 2 below.
*     - byte 9: function code (specific values to indicate which message it is in the ranging process).
*    The remaining bytes are specific to each message as follows:
*    Poll message:
*     - no more data
*    Response message:
*     - byte 10 -> 13: poll message reception timestamp.
*     - byte 14 -> 17: response message transmission timestamp.
*    All messages end with a 2-byte checksum automatically set by DW1000.
* 2. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants in this example to keep it simple but for a real product every device should have a
*    unique ID. Here, 16-bit addressing is used to keep the messages as short as possible but, in an actual application, this should be done only
*    after an exchange of specific messages used to define those short addresses for each device participating to the ranging exchange.
* 3. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of the message as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
*    automatically appended by the DW1000. This means that our variable could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
*    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
* 4. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
*    refer to DW1000 User Manual for more details on "interrupts". It is also to be noted that STATUS register is 5 bytes long but, as the event we
*    use are all in the first bytes of the register, we can use the simple dwt_read32bitreg() API call to access it instead of reading the whole 5
*    bytes.
* 5. The high order byte of each 40-bit time-stamps is discarded here. This is acceptable as, on each device, those time-stamps are not separated by
*    more than 2**32 device time units (which is around 67 ms) which means that the calculation of the round-trip delays can be handled by a 32-bit
*    subtraction.
* 6. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
*     DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
* 7. The use of the carrier integrator value to correct the TOF calculation, was added Feb 2017 for v1.3 of this example.  This significantly
*     improves the result of the SS-TWR where the remote responder unit's clock is a number of PPM offset from the local inmitiator unit's clock.
*     As stated in NOTE 2 a fixed offset in range will be seen unless the antenna delsy is calibratred and set correctly.
